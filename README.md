- ans: Type Inference in TypeScript Even if you don't write the type of a variable, TypeScript automatically infers the type and applies it. Type inference ensures safety, keeps code small, and reduces bugs.


* 02: Provide an example of using *union* and *intersection* types in TypeScript.

- ans: Union type: Can be any one of multiple types. And Intersection type: Requires all properties of multiple types together.
